              I'm a full-stack software developer who enjoys building practical, user-focused applications across mobile and web platforms. My recent work includes Android development with Kotlin and React Native, as well as building web applications that prioritize clarity, maintainability, and thoughtful design.

              Curiosity is central to how I work. I'm always learning—whether studying languages like Portuguese and French, refining my data and tooling workflows, or exploring new development approaches that strengthen my craft. That same drive to understand and improve shapes how I design, build, and iterate on software.
