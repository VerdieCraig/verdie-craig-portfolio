## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack monorepo structure with clear separation between client and server code:

- **Frontend**: React SPA with TypeScript, utilizing shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (configured but not actively used in current implementation)
- **Build System**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Deployment**: ESBuild for server bundling, standard static file serving

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui components providing a consistent design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Features**: Toast notifications, tooltips, responsive navigation

### Backend Architecture
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL support
- **Session Management**: Configured for connect-pg-simple (not actively used)
- **Development Tools**: Hot reload with Vite integration
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user structure with id, username, and password fields
- **ORM**: Drizzle with type-safe queries and migrations
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking

## Data Flow

1. **Static Portfolio Content**: All portfolio content is hardcoded in React components
2. **User Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for user data (MemStorage class)
3. **API Routes**: Currently minimal, designed for future expansion
4. **Client-Server Communication**: React Query handles API calls and caching
